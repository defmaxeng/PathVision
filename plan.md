# Planning File


## August 8th, 2025
Today I am going to attempt residual networks.

## August 6th, 2025
I'm decently sure that all this time my pth tests were actually fine. The real problem was that my neural network was giving the same lane prediction for every image because likely it isn't complex enough. 

Improvements for the future:
 - More complex neural network
 - Clean up downsize.py
 - Clean up pth_test.py, delete pth_tests.py
 - make masterfile.py copy itself to each saved model -> done
 - separate nn model into it's own file -> done
 - Batch normalization
 - Residual neural networks


## August 3rd, 2025
Goals:
 - Achieve functioning pth_test


## August 1st, 2025
Goals:
 - Visualize Neural Network overlayed on the image
 - Begin trying augmented reality
 - Start learning OpenStreetMaps
